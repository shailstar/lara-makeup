               <p>Kanika Chanda was my makeup artist on my engagement day and I really liked her work. She was the best of all.
                   She had done a great job and I loved my look. Even the hairstyle looked so good. In fact, everyone praised it.
                   I would recommend her any day! The best one that there is! She did exactly what I wanted plus made my bridal makeup experience really fun.
                   She is really good at her work.

                <p> So I decided to get my make up done by you on my big day only because I had quite liked your work at an exhibition..never did I expect that getting my make up done by Kanika Chanda best makeup artist in Gurgaon would be an experience in itself altogether..a beautiful one at that..more than the vatnaas and the poojas, it was the way you treated me and calmed me down throughout that made me glow on my big day.
                    Needless to say, the complements still haven't stopped pouring yet—for sagan and wedding—both.
                    I have to admit one thing though: When my not—so-expressive husband saw me entering at the wedding, he complimented me from a distance..and trust me, I did think about you at that moment as well.
                    Thanks a lot, Kanika..lt was lovely getting ready by you and it was lovelier getting to know you as a makeup artist..lots of love
                    Sonakshi

                <p>Booking Kanika Chanda was one of the best choices I made. I'm glad I chose her for the function.
                    I received a lot of compliments for my make up. I absolutely loved how she worked her magic on me.
                    Even though I have oily skin she successfully tackled and overcame it.
                    She is an extremely talented makeup artist and perfected co-ordinated the makeup with my outfit.
                    It was not only about the makeup but also the suggestion and recommendations she gave me along with it. All the brides should definitely book her now if they want a perfectly flawless wedding look. PS. You have an amazing studio. Looking forward to seeing you again!
